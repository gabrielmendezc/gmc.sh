   with valid values.
3. `npm install`

## Testing and CI

All tests, lints and type checks are ran on every push with github actions to
make sure nothing broken gets into production. You can run some of these tests
locally with `npm t` or `npm test` or `npm run test`.

To run the E2E Cypress tests you must create a `cypress.env.json` in the
project's root with the keys in `cypress.env.sample.json`, these keys must be
filled with valid values otherwise tests won't work properly.
